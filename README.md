# Omni-Board

Omni-Board: The dashboard for your raspberry pi vitals. The way it works is simple: You install an agent on your raspberry pi, setup the dashboard on a webserver (maybe on that very pi) and voila! You got yourself a nifty, little dashboard.

This getting started guide is not ready for production yet. Whenever I implement a new feature, I add it to the installation guide.

## Todos

Since this is a work in progress, here is a quick todo list. It's mostly for me, tbh.

- [x] Role Based Access Control
- [ ] Transaction Handling 
- [x] Logging-System
- [ ] Refactoring of Error Messages using an Enum
- [ ] Settings

## Getting Started

To ensure the best possible experience, please follow the following steps in chronological order, otherwise, there might be complications, which would force you to redo all the steps, and we really don't want any more headaches, right? :)
